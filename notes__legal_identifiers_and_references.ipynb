    "primarily used for references to laws (and sometimes to regulations and other things).\n",

    "and occasionally from CVDR to laws, and in a few cases from CVDR to other CVDR entries.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The standard makes a point that these references might be referring to _any/all versions_ of a thing (here of a BWB-id)\n",
    "  - so only with these dates can it be a identifier referring to to a specific document, and unambiguously to actual text.\n",
    "  - There are some further date related nuances, such as that 'wet X, artikel Y' _without_ a geldigheidsdatum/zichtdatum to resolve it is interpreted to mean \"all versions of this where there there that artikel exists (VERIFY)"

    "<!-- -->\n",
    "\n",
    "This means 1.2's references with just geldigheidsdatum would not be unambiguous for these cases. \n",

    "\n",
    "Juriconnect 1.3 resolves this via the concepts of zichtdatum and zichtbaarheidsperiode.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the documentation's example, consider\n",
    "- consolidation X1 with a geldigheidsperiode of 1/1/2010 through 31/12/2010\n",
