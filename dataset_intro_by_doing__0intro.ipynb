        "\n",
        "A few different reasons. Some of our considerations follow:\n",
        "\n",
        "The most up to date information is often to fetch data directly from the source. We have notebooks elsewhere details how that may be done (TODO: link)\n",
        "\n",
        "If you can express what you want, then such direct fetching is also the most elegant way to get exactly what you want.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Such 'if's matter. When you have a research question, and have gone to a system that probably has the data you are looking for, ask yourself:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Does it let you _express_ what you want?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Questions like \"give me all pariamentary reports related to animal management\" may be very reasonable, but for various data sources, you will not find it easy to be sure the search results are complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Does it let you _fetch_ what you want?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Even if a site lets you search for what you need, if there is no \"download however many matching documents that is\", you can't _do_ anythign with it (beyond spending the week pressing Save as)\n",
        "\n",
        "Put another way: is there an interface to fetch data?\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, is that interface at least as expressive as the site? For example\n",
        "- the damocles example (TODO: link) may be an example of \"hey, we managed to refine our search to download a fairly precise set of documents\", but don't count on that always working.\n",
        "- whereas the KOOP BWB interface doesn't let you search in the document body, as the website will.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Maybe you just wanted a lot of data**\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to test a text processing method,\n",
        "maybe you just wanted a lot of text of some different types,\n",
        "no matter yet what it is exactly. Both site and API will would be slow.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Even if we provide code to make finding-and-fetchin easier,\n",
        "_to end users_ that may only really move around the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you just wanted to focus on the _documents_, chances are you now need to stare at our code for an afternoon before you get it to work -- or discover that it would never have done what you expecting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Or maybe you now have PDF of XML, and now have a different question before you can start working on _text_.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
